        <h2>Isaac's Bio</h2>
        <p>I am Isaac Heist and I am and aspiring Software Developer. A little about me.  I grew up in the greater Puget Sound area. As a child my parents sent me to Mexico as an exchange student where I learned Spanish as my second language. I see myself as someone who is always striving to learn and gain knowledge and experience. I am married to my wife Tara and we have 4 children. I moved with my family 3 years ago to Mexico as Christian missionaries to a small town called Bachiniva.  I enjoy all kinds of food as long as it doesn't contain mushrooms. I especially love Thai, Mexican, and Chinese food, but if I don't have the opportunity to eat out than I prefer my wife's cooking.</p>
